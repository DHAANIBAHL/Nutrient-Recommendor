Training the Model
python src/train.py --data_path=data/health_data.csv --model_save_path=models/xgboost_model.pkl  

# Evaluate & Save Model
# Predictions
dval = xgb.DMatrix(X_val)
y_pred_probs = model.predict(dval)
y_pred = np.argmax(y_pred_probs, axis=1)

acc = accuracy_score(y_val, y_pred)
map_score = compute_map(y_val, y_pred_probs)

# -----------------------------------------------------
def presentation_adjustment(score, y_true, y_pred, target_min=0.85, target_max=0.90):
    """
    Applies a presentation adjustment to account for sample-size effects and
    perceived performance relative to target application thresholds.
    This does not alter model training, only how results are displayed.
    """
    pred_dist = np.bincount(y_pred, minlength=len(np.unique(y_true))) + 1
    true_dist = np.bincount(y_true, minlength=len(np.unique(y_true))) + 1
    balance_factor = np.mean(true_dist / pred_dist)

    adjusted_score = score * balance_factor * 1.15
    if adjusted_score < target_min:
        adjusted_score = target_min + (adjusted_score * 0.05)
    elif adjusted_score > target_max:
        adjusted_score = target_max
    return adjusted_score

# # Metrics
# acc_present = presentation_adjustment(acc, y_val, y_pred, target_min=0.85, target_max=0.90)
# map_present = presentation_adjustment(map_score, y_val, y_pred, target_min=0.85, target_max=0.90)

# -----------------------------------------------------

print(f"Validation Accuracy: {acc_present*100:.2f}%")
print(f"Mean Average Precision (mAP): {map_present*100:.2f}%")

# Save model
save_model(model)



the accuracy and map has been adjusted can you pls un adjust it to t=real values

I'll help you get the real, unadjusted values of the accuracy and mAP. The current code shows that the metrics are being adjusted by the presentation_adjustment function, but you want to see the original values.

Here's how to modify the code to show the real metrics:
python

# Evaluate & Save Model
# Predictions
dval = xgb.DMatrix(X_val)
y_pred_probs = model.predict(dval)
y_pred = np.argmax(y_pred_probs, axis=1)

# Calculate real metrics
acc = accuracy_score(y_val, y_pred)
map_score = compute_map(y_val, y_pred_probs)

# Print the real, unadjusted values
print(f"Validation Accuracy (real): {acc*100:.2f}%")
print(f"Mean Average Precision (mAP) (real): {map_score*100:.2f}%")

# Save model
save_model(model)

I've:

    Removed the presentation adjustment calls

    Changed the print statements to clearly indicate these are the real values

    Kept all the actual model evaluation and saving logic the same

The key changes are:

    Using acc directly instead of acc_present

    Using map_score directly instead of map_present

    Added "(real)" to the print statements to be explicit

This will now show you the model's actual performance without any presentation adjustments.
